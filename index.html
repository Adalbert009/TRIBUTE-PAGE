            <h3 id="headline">The BMW M5 is a high performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed under the BMW M sub-brand. It is considered an iconic vehicle in the sports sedan category. The majority of M5`s have been produced in the sedan (saloon) body style, but
                in some countries the M5 was also available as a wagon (estate) from 1992 to 1995 and from 2006 to 2010.

                <li><strong>E28 M5 (1984–1988)</strong> The first M5 model was hand-built on the E28 535i chassis with a modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production sedan at the time. M5 models have been produced for every generation of
                    the 5 Series since 1985.</li>

                    <strong>E39 M5 (1998–2003)</strong> Introduced in 1998 at the Geneva Motor Show, the E39 generation of the M5 was the first M5 to use a V8 engine, resulting in an increase in power output to 294 kW (400 PS). It is also the first M5
                    to use aluminium front suspension components and a multi-link rear suspension. Production began in October 1998.

                    <strong>E60/E61 M5 (2005–2010)</strong> The E60 M5 was introduced in 2005, with a V10 engine and 7-speed transmission linking the car with the BMW Sauber Formula One program. The E60 M5 was the world's first production sedan to use
                    a V10 petrol engine. This generation of the M5 was also built in the E61 Touring (wagon) body style, which was only sold in Europe. The E63/E64 M6 coupé and convertible are based on a shortened version of the M5 chassis and largely
                    use the same mechanical components.

                    <strong>F10 M5 (2011–2016)</strong> The F10 M5 was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show and sales began in November 2011. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged V8 engine, making it the first turbocharged M5 model. The gearbox in
                    most markets is a 7-speed Magna 7DCI600 dual-clutch transmission marking the first time an M5 has used a dual-clutch transmission. A traditional 6-speed manual transmission was also available in the United States.

                    <strong>F90 M5 (2017–present)</strong> The F90 M5 is based on the G30 5 Series and uses an all-wheel drive ("xDrive") powertrain, being the first time that an M5 has not been rear-wheel drive. However the all-wheel drive system is
                    biased towards the rear wheels. It can also be configured to send power to the rear wheels only, if the electronic stability control (ESC) is disabled. The transmission is an 8-speed ZF 8HP45 automatic.

                    <strong>M5 competition</strong> The BMW M5 Competition model was introduced in August 2018, with power increased to 460 kW (617 hp) at 6,000 rpm and torque remaining unchanged at 750 N⋅m (553 lb⋅ft) between 1,800–5,800 rpm. The official
                    0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time was reduced by 0.1 seconds compared with the regular M5 meaning 0-100km/h (62 mph) takes 3.1 seconds in accordance with BMW. Other changes include stiffer springs, increased front camber, a 7 mm
                    (0.3 in) lower ride height, revised wheels and a redesigned exhaust system with a particulate filter added. In a test by sport auto the M5 Competition lapped the Nürburgring in 7:35.90.
